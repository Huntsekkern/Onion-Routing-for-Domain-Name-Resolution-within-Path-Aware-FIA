# Onion Routing for Domain Name Resolution within Path Aware FIA

This is my Master semester project done within the context of my Cybersecurity Master jointly from EPFL and ETHZ.

Code-related README are available in sub-folders.

It was done for the Network Security Group (https://netsec.ethz.ch/) and aims to implements privacy technologies available for the SCION Internet architecture (https://scion-architecture.net/).

Feel free to request my report in a paper-like structure for more detailed information, reasoning and design choices.
